# Gameplay

- Find all crystals hidden in the level and return them to your base.

- Defeat dangerous monsters by using Energy Ball ability or tools in the levels. Once your health reach 0, it is Game Over and the level needs to be restarted.

- The more crystals you carry, the slower you will walk. Be mindful when it is time to return to base!

- Currently, there are 2 playable levels.

- Rotate the camera with Q to the left, or E to the right. Sometimes a different perspecive can bring many answers!
